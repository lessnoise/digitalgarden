Andy Matuschak proposed the term **[Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C)** meant to allow us to create our own personal knowledge bank of interconnected original thoughts rather than the typical random notes we never come back to.

He based his system on **[Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann)'s** slipbox, while introducing a few key differences.

Evergreen notes should:

-   Be concept oriented
-   Be written for yourself
-   Use associative ontologies
-   Be [[PKM/Atomic Notes\|atomic]]

Now, let's dive deeper into what all of this means.

Notice the "atomic" link in the above paragraph. It's not a link that hadn't been created yet but there is also no note by that name.

Use the | to make a link say something other than the title of the note. Inside the double brackets, use NOTE TITLE|Text to show

## The Timeless Essence of the Evergreen

An evergreen tree stays green year-round. And like an evergreen tree, a well-written evergreen note will stay relevant and useful for years to come.

One common misconception about evergreen notes is that they are unchanging. This isn’t true of evergreen trees or notes. Everlasting does not mean never changing. Most evergreen notes will never be finished. They are living, changing, and growing documents.

You can and should update them when you learn new information or your perspective has changed.

Evergreen notes are meant to not only evolve over time but accumulate. As you link evergreen notes into a thriving forest, their value continues to compound.

The more evergreen notes you have, and the more densely linked they are, the more fruitful your idea labyrinth will become.

An evergreen note captures the essence of what you learn.

They are the building blocks that help you form original ideas and make creating content faster and more fun.

To write effective evergreen notes, you should follow these guidelines:

- [[Evergreen notes should be organized associatively\|Evergreen notes should be organized associatively]]

Atomic notes can be combined to create more complex ideas. Once your mind garden grows large enough, you’ll be able to write entire books this way.

If you think of each note in your garden as a flower, you can pick and choose the notes (flowers) you need for a specific project, arrange them, add in some adornments such as intros, transitions, and conclusions, and create a beautiful bouquet.

This is the power and beauty of evergreen notes.

By taking care to write notes that are evergreen & atomic you can create a mind garden that grows and evolves with you.
