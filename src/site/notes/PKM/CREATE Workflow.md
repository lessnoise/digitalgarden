# CREATE Workflow #branch
*Cultivate a Creative Mind Garden with the CREATE Workflow*

Path: [[Mind Garden\|Mind Garden]]
[[HOME\|HOME]]

CREATE is an extremely flexible, non-linear workflow. It's not about rigidly following each step with equal intensity; rather, it's about finding a rhythm that works for you. Some parts of CREATE might be a daily practice, while others could be weekly or monthly endeavors.

CREATE是一个非常灵活、非线性的工作流程。它不是严格按照每个步骤同样的强度进行，而是要找到适合自己的节奏。CREATE的某些部分可能是每天都要实践的，而其他部分可能是每周或每月进行一次的努力。

I think many people see the complex workflows and feel they'll never have time for all of that. But it's really not as daunting as it seems. 

**It primarily requires a change in [[mindset\|mindset]] so that you're focusing your attention in the right direction.**

I developed CREATE to be a catchy and easy-to-remember acronym that encapsulates the traditional stages of [[PKM/Personal Knowledge Management\|Personal Knowledge Management]].

It's cyclical and continuously evolving.
It spirals upward, grows out, and overlaps creating an intricate, expanding [[labyrinth\|labyrinth]].
